        "Still not entirely clear about what you just heard, you remember the dead chicken that you are still holding under your arm. You slowly start moving towards your house again. Lost in thought, you barely notice what is going on around you. You cross the big square in the center of the village, which is now a bit busier, but still far from full. A delicious smell of food hits you from the tavern that you now walk around, making your stomach grumble. Ah how you miss your Mother's cooking. Of course, Sophie is doing her best, but it is just not the same. You head down the small streets between the houses of the North-Western quarter towards your home. Turning around a corner, you suddenly stand in front of your best friend Peter, who looks everything else but good. His face is completely white and his eyes keep darting around. As soon as he notices you, he jumps back a bit, but then relaxes and leans against the wall.",
        "Ah, it's just you Taurin. Carrying around a dead chicken? Don't tell me you went to that lousy Greenwood butcher?",
        "And what if I did? You know what, I actually saw something quite interesting down there. The village guards were bringing Oscar to prison for punching Junior k.o. last night. Crazy, right? What the hell was that stupid Greenwood thinking?",
        "What?",
        "Yeah apparently, Oscar got super violent after Junior just asked to see his daughter. Even though, actually Thomas just said...",
        "Peter seems to have grown more nervous again. He grabs you by the shoulders and pushes you into the shadowy area of the small street. ",
        "That is not what happened. Well kinda, but not really. Taurin you got to listen...",
        "He opens his mouth to continue, but then seems to reconsider and closes it again, looking away to the side. ",
        "Ah, nevermind. Forget what I just said, okay?",
        "Wait, what do you mean by that is not what happened?",
        "I just told you to forget it, alright? You have to promise to tell nobody about what I just said, okay? I promised Junior, otherwise...",
        "Calm down Peter. It's okay. It's just me, you know, Taurin, your best friend. Now, you come on, tell me what's up. ",
        "But Junior said that if I tell anybody what really happened, he'll tell Eric that I am lying. And then Eric will kick me out of the clan and then nobody will care anymore what happens to me and then my life will be horrible and I will starve somewhere in the forest...",
        "Wow, wow, wow. Slow down a little. None of that will happen. If you just tell me it will be alright. And if Junior makes trouble, we'll just mess him up a bit. In the end, even a lowly Greenwood was able to beat him.",
        "Taurin, I'm not sure. But I guess, if it's only you, I will be okay. Junior wouldn't mind you knowing anyways probably. So this is what happened: You know how we went to the tavern yesterday and got pretty drunk? Well, at some point Oscar's daughter walked past, a pretty little thing, and Junior decided to take a shot at her. He went out of the tavern and asked her to come in for a drink with him. After she refused, he got a bit rougher, doing the whole 'do you know who you're talking to' number, so she got scared and ran. He went after, but was too drunk to run, so he didn't catch her before she reached the house. I went after him to get him back inside and keep him from doing anything stupid, but he was dead set on getting that girl into the tavern. When we arrived at Oscar's place, she must have already told the smith about everything, so when Junior knocked on the door, he came out with a pretty angry expression on his face. Junior seemed to be completely unaware of this and told the smith to get his daughter down so they could have a fun time. Oscar said, that she didn't want to have anything to do with Junior, so Junior got angry. He said, well if she doesn't want to, I guess I'll have to force her and tried to march past him into the house. That's when Oscar grabbed Junior and told him to leave right now, but Junior resisted screaming that a dirty Greenwood does not have the right to touch a Mountainspring such as him. He said, you Greenwoods don't understand anything but force anyways, so that is what he is going to use on Oscar's girl. That he was gonna take her, whether she wanted or not. That is when Oscar got really angry and punched Junior right in the face. Junior just fell right backwards onto the street. He just lay there, not moving. It was super scary. I ran over to him and he had blood all over his face. For a moment, I thought he was dead, but then I saw his chest moving to breathe. I tried to apologize to Oscar about what happened, but when I saw his face, I froze. Man, that guy can be scary. He went back inside and slammed the door behind him, leaving Junior and I on the street. Since Junior was still unconscious, I tried to carry him back to his place, but man that guy is heavy. So I just put him down in one of the side streets and waited for him to wake up. Then we walked back together to the North-Western quarter, but he told me to leave him be before we reached the main square. He made me promise to not tell anybody about what happened and then left for his house. I was too scared to do anything for the rest of the night, so I just went home. And now they have arrested Oscar for attacking Junior unprovoked. But it wasn't unprovoked. As much as I despise those Greenwoods, I can understand why Oscar did it. This just is not fair.",
        "But who cares, nothing is gonna change for us and a Greenwood's life is miserable anyways. Whatever they are gonna do to him, will not make things worse.",
        "Right, who cares, if a Greenwood will get a bit hurt. That has nothing to do with us. Well see you later. We'll have a quite a bit of a spectacle, huh?",
        "See you later Taurin. Yeah, right, a spectacle. It will be fun.",
        "This is not right. As much as I hate to say it, Oscar has done nothing wrong. And they are gonna punish him really bad. We have to do something about it.",
        "I'll bring the chicken home and meet you at your house, yeah? And Peter, calm down, we'll be fine. But we can't just let this happen.",
        "I guess you are right. We have to do something. See you soon."
