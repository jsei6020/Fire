         "You cross the street and close in on the butcher's shop. This will be enough interaction with Greenwoods that you can allow yourself for today in order not to get taunted for it by your friends tonight in the tavern. Not that you would want to spend any time with them in the first place, of course. Greenwoods are dirty bastards that can not be trusted; every Mountainspring that is clear in their head knows that. With these thouhgts on your mind, you enter the place of the butcher and his wife. The ground floor has two entrances, one from the road that you just entered through, and one leading out to the small square at the center of the South-Western quarter. The butcher's wife is standing with roled up slieves behind the counter, looking out of the window next to the latter door. Seemingly observing some sort of extremely important proceeding outside. You make yourself noticed by walking around as loud as you can and she turns around to give you an annoyed look. As soon as she recognizes you that turns into in almost angry glare as she opens her mouth to speak with obvious animosity.",
        "And what do you want little Mountainspring?",
        "My Father has sent me to buy a chicken.",
        "Has he now? So why should I care that he has sent you. Do you have any intention of actually buying one as well?",
        "I don't understand what you mean. Didn't I just say...",
        "Listen little dipshit, if you come in here with your nose high like that and completely full of yourself, I don't want to see you any longer than necessary to get your money. So just say: I want to buy a chicken. I want to buy a chicken.",
        "Okay, okay. I want to buy a chicken.",
        "Now there you go little Mountainspring; that'll make 6 Bitcoin.",
        "Wait, wait, wait. That is two times more than last time. Last time I came here it was 3 Bitcoin. Why am I suddenly supposed to pay 6? I demand an explanation.",
        "You want an explanation? Then go to that door and take a look outside. That's why.",
        "Very upset, but a bit too scared of a woman with a butcher's knife in her hand to straight up refuse, you turn to the door, open it and look outside.",
        "You see how the four village guards in full uniform are escorting Oscar Greenwood out of his house. It's not like they could really do anything to stop him, if he decided to resist, but the massive mountain of muscle that makes up the man renowned to be the best smith far and wide calmly walks in their middle with a mix of anger and superiority on his face. What might he have done? You notice Erin at the side of the small square you are standing on and walk to him.",
        "Hey Erin, what happened here?",
        "Last night, Eric Jr., the son of our clan's leader, came here to pay a friendly visit to the smith's daughter. Instead of coming out like a proper, curtious woman should, she sent her father, who, after listening to Junior's request, pulled him up by is collar, threatening him. Since Junior, of course did not give in to such a dirty Greenwood, he heroically and rightfully resisted, whereupon Oscar punched Junior's lights out. Now, I do not know what Junior would want from one of those muddled and unpure Greendwood lasses, but punching somebody unconscious without provocation is not the way to treat another villager. Therefore Oscar will be detained and put on trial for his crime as soon as possible. But there are few punishments harsh enough for such an insult to our clan. Disgraceful Greenwoods. They are a shame to our village.",
        "You look at the smith being escorted away towards the village center. Of course, only a Greenwood could have committed such a disgusting action. Who the hell do they think they are attacking a Mountainspring. Especially the son of our clan's leader! This is proof they are just a bunch of low lives without any manners. All they know is stabbing people in their backs and using any opportunity to take advantage of you. Pigs!",
        "As expected of a lowly Greenwood. Just letting out the misery of their lives onto anybody that comes along. Disgusting!",
        "You have seen enough and go back.",
        "You return to the butcher, facing Carla with her butcher's knife in hand. ",
        "As if you have any reason to be mad about anything. Your clan has just once again proven its worthlessness.",
        "You put three Bitcoin on the counter, snatch the chicken and turn towards the door that leads to the big, cobbled street to the Southern gate. Trying to walk as straight and confident as possible, you leave the shop. All the way to the door you feel two scorching coals burning into your back, but somehow you make it outside alive. Phew, that was scary. In the end, these Greenwoods showed what they are capable of last night and Carla had a knife in her hand. You could have ended up finely chopped up, Stoooooooop! Don't even think about it. These Greenwoods should not even dare touching any Mountainspring. And they definitely won't after they hear Oscar's punishment. In the end, the mayor and judge at the trial is none other than Arthur Mountainspring, Eric's younger brother and Junior's uncle.",
