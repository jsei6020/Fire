        "Who cares about errands? There finally seems to be something exciting going on in this town. You start running after Erin and catch up with him at the main square of the village. He is going into the annex of the small meeting hall, where the guards must be gathering right now to go on their morning patrol. You wait outside of the long, wooden building with the straw roof that serves as the office of the mayor of Elsberry and if necessary hosts big village gatherings. You were allowed to come a few times before and the last time even as a full member. You kept quiet for most of the meeting though. It is not like there is anything important to say in the first place. What do you care about how to protect the village from robbers and deserters? It's not like that would ever happen. Now, Erin comes out of the annex again, followed by all four guards in full uniform. He seems to think himself the most important man in the world as he is guiding them into the South-Western quarter. You walk next to him and try to appear as desinterested as possible to not feed this undeserved feeling of self-importance.",
        "Hey Erin, what happened?",
        "Last night, Eric Jr., the son of our clan's leader, went to pay a friendly visit to Oscar Greenwood's daughter. Instead of coming out like a proper, curtious woman should, she sent her father, who, after listening to Junior's request, pulled him up by is collar, threatening him. Since Junior of course did not give in to such a dirty Greenwood, he heroically and rightfully resisted, whereupon Oscar punched Junior's lights out. Now, I do not know what Junior would want from one of those muddled and unpure Greendwood lasses, but punching somebody unconscious without provocation is not the way to treat another villager. So now we are going to arrest that piece of horseshit and put him on trial. But there are few punishments harsh enough for such an insult to our clan. Disgraceful Greenwoods, they are a shame to our village.",
        "You have reached the small square that is at the center of the South-Western quarter and the guards and Erin move towards Oscar's door. Oscar is by far the best smith far and wide, but your father does not trust him, which is why he always buys from Tarik, the sad excuse for this profession living in the South-Eastern quarter. But now Oscar has delivered more than justification for your dad's prejudices. Of course, only a Greenwood could have committed such a disgusting action. Who the hell do they think they are attacking a Mountainspring? Especially the son of our clan's leader. This is proof they are just a bunch of low lives without any manners. All they know is stabbing people in their backs and using any opportunity to take advantage of you. Pigs!",
        "You see Erin knocking on Oscar's door who opens and after recongizing the blond boy and the four guards behind him, turns red with anger. You can't understand what they are saying, but suddenly the smith's expression changes and he lets the guards grab him and escort him away. Or at least they try to. It's not like they could really do anything to stop him, if he decided to resist. But the massive mountain of muscle that makes up this disgusting man calmly walks in their middle with a mix of anger and superiority on his face. Well that will change as soon as he is put on trial. In the end, the mayor of this village and judge of every criminal action is Paul Mountainspring, Eric's younger brother and Junior's uncle. His punishment will be harsh, just as he deserves.",
        "You have seen enough. Better get back to your errands before somebody sees you and tells your father. The butcher is on this square."
