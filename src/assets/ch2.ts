        "You don’t want anything to do with the Greenwoods and therefore nothing that happens in their part of the village. Anyways, if somebody sees you slacking off and tells your father, you would be in for a hard time, so you start walking again. To your left is the majestic house that Erin must have just come from: the leader of your Clan, Clan Mountainspring, lives right there. It is one of the few stone houses in the village, along with the small town hall, the unexpectedly big trading post run by the Greenwoods and the bakery. The house goes over two stories and has skillful carvings framing the façade. But most impressive is the man that lives inside it: Eric Mountainspring. You have met him several times before and were always a bit intimidated by not only his size but also his sheer presence that commands attention whenever he enters the room. He is a good man though. He might be a bit harsh sometimes, but he has always acted kindly towards you. Your father owes a lot to him, so your existence has basically been granted through his mercy. Yes, Eric is a good man. You can be proud to be part of his clan.",
        "The smith is probably the closest, so you start with that. You keep walking between the smaller houses and cross the cobbled road that leads to the eastern exit of the village, passing into the South-Eastern Quarter. There is nothing much here except for the herbalist, tailor, and the mill. Oh and of course that second rate smith Tarik that you are going to right now. Everybody knows that Oscar Greenwood is a much better craftsman, but of course he is a Greenwood. And one cannot trust a Greenwood. That is what your father and Eric have taught you from when you were a child. They cannot be trusted. ",
        "You keep moving between somewhat rundown, wooden houses, kicking up dust from the narrow lane that you are walking on. In the background, you hear some chickens cackling, as you arrive at Tarik’s house. To your dismay you see that the fire has not been started yet and its owner seems to still be asleep. But you get lucky and right when you decide to turn around, the tall man with his gigantic beer belly walks out the door.",
        "Is that you Taurin? What do you want?",
        "Father sent me to collect an order that was supposed to be done today.",
        "Right, right that thing. Well, it’s not done yet. Come back later, there is still some stuff to do.",
        "But...",
        "No buts. I told your father it would be done today and it will be done today. But not so early in the morning.",
        "Still squinting due to the brightness of the sun, you see him going to work and starting up the fire. A little annoyed, but powerless, you turn around and grumble something about why you have to get up so early, when other people don’t do either.",
"You curse at Tarik under your breath, so that you hope he doesn't hear you. At least it is starting to get a bit warmer and your hands are becoming a more acceptable color again.",
"Acting up is way to scary, so there is nothing you can do. At least it is starting to get a bit warmer and your hands are becoming a more acceptable color again."
