        "You go to the small door of the butcher shop. You have probably already spent too much time on Greenwood territory today to not to get taunted for it by your friends tonight in the tavern anyways, so you don't have to worry about that anymore. Not that you would want to spend any time with them, if you would not get taunted, of course. Greenwoods are dirty bastards that can not be trusted; every Mountainspring that is clear in their head knows that. With these thouhgts on your mind, you enter the place of the butcher and his wife. The ground floor has two entrances, one from the small square that you just entered through, and one leading out to the main road to the Southern gate. The butcher's wife is standing with roled up slieves behind the counter, looking at you as you walk in. She must have seen you coming. Probably observing what's going on outside. Typical Greenwood, sees one of her fellow clan members in trouble, but just watches instead of doing something about it. As soon as she recognizes you her expression turns into in angry glare as she opens her mouth to speak with obvious animosity.",
        "And what do you want little Mountainspring?",
        "My Father has sent me to buy a chicken.",
        "Has he now? So why should I care that he has sent you. Do you have any intention of actually buying one as well?",
        "I don't understand what you mean. Didn't I just say...",
        "Listen little dipshit, if you come in here with your nose high like that and completely full of yourself, I don't want to see you any longer than necessary to get your money. So just say: I want to buy a chicken. I want to buy a chicken.",
        "Okay, okay. I want to buy a chicken.",
        "Now there you go little Mountainspring; that'll make 6 Bitcoin.",
        "Wait, wait, wait. That is two times more than last time. Last time I came here it was 3 Bitcoin. Why am I suddenly supposed to pay 6? I demand an explanation.",
        "You want an explanation? You've seen what's going on out there. That's why.",
        "As if you have any reason to be mad about anything. Your clan has just once again proven its worthlessness.",
        "You are scared out of your mind to talk back on somebody older than you, especially if that person has a butcher's knife in their hands. You put three Bitcoin on the counter, snatch the chicken and head towards the door that leads to the big, cobbled street to the Southern gate. Trying to walk as straight and confident as possible, you leave the shop. All the way to the door you feel two scorching coals burning into your back, but somehow you make it outside alive. Phew, that was scary. In the end, these Greenwoods showed what they are capable of last night. You could have ended up finely chopped up with that butcher knife, Stoooooooop! Don't even think about it. These Greenwoods should not even dare touching any Mountainspring. And they definitely won't after they hear Oscar's punishment. In the end, the mayor and judge at the trial is none other than Paul Mountainspring, Eric's younger brother and Junior's uncle.",

        "You got the chicken. Next up: the herbalist across the street.",
