        "What a waste of time! Hopefully you will have more luck with the herbalist, a middle aged, rather slim woman by the name of Rachel with brown hair and a confusingly big nose, the clear sign of a witch. She only came to this village three years ago and set up shop in one of the abandoned houses in the South-East quarter right along the big road that leads to the Southern gate. Nobody really trusts her, because of course you never know what these witches are brewing in their cauldrons at night. Your family, however, has become too dependent on her not to award a little bit of trust. Since your mother got very sick two years ago, you have been making trips to this house every few weeks to get medicine. Rachel always seems to be very concerned, but, in the end, if she really cared, she would have come to see your mother herself and cured her properly with her witchcraft instead of always just sending some herbs. Damn her.",
        "You keep moving between somewhat rundown, wooden houses, kicking up dust from the narrow lane that you are walking on. In the background, the chickes are still active in with their annoying cackling, as you arrive at Rachelâ€™s house. You see the smoke coming out of the chimney in the roof and as soon as you enter the smell of green from all the herbs almost overwhelms you. Rachel is in the back, next to the fire, stirring something inside a cauldron.",
        "Wait a second, I'll be right there.",
        "You take a look around. Everytime you come here, you find some new interesting thing that is worth looking at. This time it is a gigantic book on the counter. You go closer and take it into your hand. The weird letters in the front still don't make any sense to you. How much you wish you could read. But father says, there is no time for such nonsense, so you spend your days running errands and taking whatever small jobs are offered around the village. In the winter, that amounted to a looooot of wood chopping. You try to open the book, but in that moment, Rachel nabs it out of your fingers and places it in a shelf behind her.",
        "That is for another day, Taurin. For now, I presume you have come again for the medicine? Here, I thought you'd run out soon, so I have already prepared the package for you. How is your mother doing? Any change of her symptoms?",
        "No, not really, she still lies in bed all day, looking at the ceiling, barely hearing what we say. The fever from the beginning is gone, but she still barely sleeps or eats. Nothing is getting better, things are only ever getting worse. And your herbs don't help at all. We give them to her and nothing happens. It has been two years!!! And she is not getting better. My little sister has to do all the household chores. And she is fourteen. This just isn't right...",
        "As you were talking you got more and more upset, raising your voice to almost shouting. Now, there she is again with that weird look in her eyes. Who does she think she is? You know that she could save your mom with her witchcraft, if she just wanted to. It's her fault that your mom is still sick and getting thinner and thinner. It's her fault that your mom will die.",
        "I am very sorry for you, Taurin. I promise, if your mom will keep taking these herbs, things will get better eventually. Please...",
        "A little bit angry, but mostly sad, you slam some of the money your father gave you on top of the counter and grab the package. Next time, you will ask her to come see your mom for sure. Next time, you will and then she has to come. Next time. You turn around to leave, trying to hold back the tears.",
        "Oh and Taurin, do you have any idea what is going on in the South-West quarter? I've seen people run over there and back for the entire morning, something serious must have happened. I have to watch the fire here for a few more hours. If you find out what is going on, will you come by and tell me?",
        "With these words, you turn around and leave for the outside world again. The sun is starting to break through the clouds above and it is getting warmer. Your body is finally not so stiff from all the cold anymore. You take a deep breath. Last one: the Butcher."
