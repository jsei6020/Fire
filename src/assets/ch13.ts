"You promised her, so you will tell her. The more people know what those filthy Greenwoods did the better. You start walking through the small streets towards her house. You see some people crowding together and chattering, but avoid the central square, where they must be making the last preparations for the trial. The sun is still shining with all its might down on you warming your skin, but a slight breeze blows fresh air into your face. How you wish you could just forget all this and leave it behind. But reality is that you are a Mountainspring and therefore it is your task to take care of the village, even if that means getting rid of dirty Greenwoods, so they stop causing trouble. You reach Rachel's house and open the door. Rachel is sitting on a big chair reading in the gigantic book that was on the counter earlier. When she hears you she closes it with a big thump and gives you a hint of a smile.",

"Ahh, Taurin. Did you give the medicine to your mother? Did she say something about it. I added something special time. Did it change anything?",

"Uhhhh, I wasn't really there when they gave her the medicine. My sister usually does that. I came to tell you that Oscar the Greenwood blacksmith will be put on trial this afternoon. We will get his right punishment for the horrible things that he did. Just attacked Junior last night and punched unconscious. Out of the blue. I've seen the guards arrest him this morning.",

"Is that so? Now that doesn't sound like Oscar, why would he do something like that?",

"He's a damn Greenwood, that's why. Junior came politely and asked to see Oscar's pretty little daughter and bam, a punch straight in the face. Now that is no way to treat another citizen!",

"It still seems a bit weird to me. Oscar is usually such a temperate man...",

"Anyways, the trial will be this afternoon.",

"Rachel nods, but seems to be lost in her thoughts. You turn around and leave her house. There's probably still a little bit of time before the trial starts, but better be safe. You do not want to miss this spectacle. Finally something is happening in this village!",


"You should come to the trial too. The more people come to see him get punished and help bring justice to these bastards, the better.",

"Maybe, I will come. But don't except me to 'bring justice' to them like you are imagining. You can go. Thank you for telling me.",

"You turn around and leave her house. There's probably still a little bit of time before the trial starts, but better be safe. You do not want to miss this spectacle. You start walking back towards the main square. Finally something is happening in this village!",
