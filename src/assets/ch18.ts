"You walk about fifty meters and find yourself standing in front of a small wooden house. Not much different from most other structures in the village, this one fits the needs of the people living inside even worse than elsewhere. Peter is the third of eight children who are all cramped up on one floor sectioned off into three rooms, one room for the parents with the youngest child, not much more than a year old, one room for the oldest four children, and the family room, cooking area and dining area containing the three smaller ones who still fit on the benches to sleep. The crampedness at home combined with the lack of attention a third child receives, Peter has lived his life mostly lounging outside in the village or beyond its borders. He makes a great companion who will go with you on all sorts of adventures and can keep his mouth shut afterwards. Except this time. This time was different.",

"After waiting for a while, Peter comes out of the door and walks over to your side of the street. His face displays dread. He seems to be regretting that he ever said anything. ",

"Don't look so down, Peter. Are you trying to pull out now? If you did not think that we should do something, then you should have never told me.",

"You kinda bullied me into it, but in the end you are right. We can not just let Oscar be sentenced for something he did not do. Greenwood or not. But what do we do, Taurin? I mean, Paul will be holding the trial and he is definitely not going to call his nephew a liar. Can we even really change anything. Even if we know the truth, does it really matter?",

"Well, I think people should at least know what really happened. It's not like this entire thing is gonna be a careful reading of some lawbook, followed by a rightful sentence. They want to punish these miserable Greenwoods. Give them what they deserve for ruining our lives because of their jealousy...",

"So, why are we stopping them then. Greenwoods are good for nothing. Our parents have said that since we were little kids.",

"Wait, wait, wait. We're doing what we have always done again. Thinking exactly how they taught us to. Here we have evidence that they are not right. That the ideas of our parents do not always hold true. Thomas told me about that before I met you. That we should think for ourselves. That we can determine by ourselves what we think is right. I think, he was talking about this sort of thing. He said that we have to throw away the beliefs given by society that are no longer serving us. Whatever that is supposed to mean.",

"Should we ask Thomas to explain it again? Maybe we should just tell him about what I saw and then he can tell us what to do? I honestly have no idea.",


"You are right, maybe we should just tell him about what you saw. He will know about a way to get out of this mess.",


"No, we don't have the time for that. And this is exactly what he told me. That we can decide for ourselves what is right. That it is our power to determine what to do. Let's come up with a way ourselves.",

"If you think so... But what do we do?",

"I think, our best bet is to tell the others in the village about what happened. They plan to put on Oscar's trial in front of everyone. That means that they need the people to agree with what they are doing. If we can show others, that punishing Oscar is wrong, maybe we can protect him.",

"Are you sure Taurin? But who of the Mountainsprings will change their mind about this? Also, if we tell them ourselves, Eric and Paul will definitely not just let us go after that. ",

"Eric and Paul are the ones that have put these lies into our heads in the first place. We don't need them. You are right however, we will not be able to change anything about most of the Mountainsprings. Maybe our friends will listen to us, though. I'll take Olli and Aaron. You try to persuade Michael and Goldy. And my dad told me to do some errands, so I have to go to the baker and the smith anyways. Maybe you can try the glass workshop? Perhaps they will listen to what we have to say.",

"Wow, have you really just said that? Did you just call Eric Mountainspring and his little brother liars? This is scary. Thinking for yourself is scary. Eric always knows what is right. Who are you to go against him? But Peter is giving you a reluctant nod, so you start moving between the small houses towards your friend Olli's usual hide out."
