      "With the chicken under your arm, you make yourself on the way back to your house. What you just heard bothered you somewhere deep inside. A place with a feeling that you didn't think you had. You always acted on what others said was right. This feeling to act is based on what YOU think is right. It feels really scary. If this goes wrong, it's on you. Nobody to blame anymore. You kick up some dust on the street you are walking on and pass onto the small square at the center of the North-Western quarter. Suddenly the door of the clan leader's gigantic house swings open and the boulder of a man himself emerges into the outside. Eric Mountainspring, with his long brown hair and elegant blue cloak, starts walking across the square with a conviction in his steps that would make anyone cower out of his way. He notices you and gives you a friendly nod.",
"You try to mirror his nod, but end up making a small bow. There is just no way that that man and you are equals. Can you really defy something that this man has told you? The thought fills you with fear. You keep walking toward your house and enter the living room, where your little sister is sitting next to the stove, stitching some old clothes.",

"Taurin, you're already back! Do you have mothers herbs? She really needs the medicine, but I used everything up yesterday.",

"Yes, of course, here you go! And the chicken as well.",

"Sophie takes the herbs and chicken out of your hand and looks at you concerned. Do you still look unsettled from what Peter told you? But you can't blend out anymore what you just heard.",

"Are you alright, Taurin? Did something happen?",

"I'm alright, but something did happen. They arrested Oscar, the Greenwood blacksmith, for attacking Junior last night without any warning. Even though I am not sure I can believe that.",

"Oh no, is Junior alright?",

"Funny, in all this time, you have not given a single thought to how Junior was doing. But then again that snake doesn't deserve any concern. The clan is going to do poorly when he will be in charge.",

"I don't know how Junior is doing. I do know, however, that they're gonna put Oscar on trial and punish him even though he is innocent.",

"Sophie looks a bit strange at you, but then gives you a big smile and turns away to prepare the herbs for your mother. You have started feeling hungry for some lunch, so you go over to the cupboard and grab yourself some bread and slice of a small chunk of cheese. As you munch on the hard bread, Sophie disappears upstairs to give your mother her medicine. You think about following her for a second, but decide not to. For some reason, you are scared to look at your mother. Everytime you see her frail body, sunken in eyes and hollow cheeks, it scares the life out of you. All you want is for her to be back to normal. But that annoying witch just won't come over and heal her properly. Next time. Next time, you'll ask her to come. Lost in thoughts, nibbling on your food, time flies by.",

"Suddenly your father breaks through the door. With his back against the light, you can't read his expression, but the way he slams the door shut behind him and stomps over to the food cupboard, can not mean anything good. Why is he here? He should be out for the entire day, overseeing Eric's fields. When you were still a child, your father still worked in the small glass workshop up in the North-Eastern quarter, but after an accident, he suddenly refused to go back to work there. Physically he seemed to be completely fine, except for the few scars from glass cuts that everybody gets with the time working there. You tried asking him about it several times, but never got an answer from him. Usually, you just got told to shut up, sometimes you would be chased out of the room, being threatened to get a proper beating. Somehow the clan leader had taken pitty with your father and given him the job of overseeing his fields surrounding the village. Beforehand, Eric had simply done that himself, so the position did not really exist, but it gave your father work and money to bring home which got more important when your mother got sick and could not help out anymore either. Without Eric, your family would probably quite soon run out of things to eat and would have to depend on donations to stay alive. But still why was your father here? Suddenly your old man disrupts your thoughts, starting to speak in an upset voice.",

"Have you heard? That piece of shit Oscar hit Junior in the face last night. Just like that, out of the blue. Passed right out. Miserable Greenwoods. How dare they just start attacking people like that? Especially the great Mountainspring clan leader's son. They hate us I tell you. And they hate us because they know we are better than them. They would find any excuse to let out their feelings of inferiority on us, who have done nothing wrong. They can not be trusted, seemingly not even enough to come within an arms length of them. Luckily Junior is alright, that Greenwood smith is a mountain. Do you see now why I sent you to Tarik instead? Disgusting Greenwoods. What do you think, son?",

"Honestly, I am not sure. Oscar doesn't seem like the person to attack somebody unprovoked.",

"What did you just say? I must have misheard. That damn excuse for a smith is a Greendwood and Greenwoods are nothing but despicable blood suckers. A Greenwood is the exact person that would attack someone on a simple whim and think they could get away with it. I know you don't really mean what you just said. I know that you understand a Greenwood can not be trusted.",

"Alright, enough of this! I do not want to hear of this any more. Eric called us back early, because he wants to have the trial this afternoon and we should all come and watch. I guess, he does not want to waste money on serving that piece of shit food while he's sitting around all day in a cell. Such a wise man! You see, he is an example of a man that cares about the people around him. Greenwoods on the other hand, just think of themselves and if their urges overcome them, all you can do is knock them out.", 

"Too outraged to say anything, are you? Well I can understand. Eric called us back early, because he wants to have the trial this afternoon and we should all come and watch. I guess, he does not want to waste money on serving that piece of shit food while he's sitting around all day in a cell. Such a wise man! You see, he is a true example of a man that cares about the people around him. Greenwoods on the other hand, just think of themselves and if their urges overcome them, all you can do is knock them out.",

"Absolutely. We should just throw them all out of the village. Would become a lot nicer here, if they weren't constantly muddling our air by daring to breathe. When I went to the butcher earlier, I almost left running because of their stench.",

"You're right, it would be better if they were all just gone. But today, we shall start with that smith. Eric called us back early, because he wants to have the trial this afternoon and we should all come and watch. I guess, he does not want to waste money on serving that piece of shit food while he's sitting around all day in a cell. Such a wise man! You see, he is a true example of a man that cares about the people around him. Greenwoods on the other hand, just think of themselves and if their urges overcome them, all you can do is knock them out. ",

"So the trial will already be this afternoon. That is quick. You better do something now, or maybe this glimmer inside you will disappear again. For the first time in your life, you feel like life could actually be interesting.",

"How are your chores coming along?",

"I got the herbs from Rachel. She is cooking up some potion in the back of her house that I don't like at all. Stupid witch. I also got the chicken from the butcher! But going to Tarik was a waste of time. When I came to him, he had not even started working. Said to come back later.",

"Well then go to that damn Tarik again and get our order. And I just saw we are almost out of bread so go fetch some of that for us too. The money you have left should be enough for a loaf right?",

"Actually, I had to pay twice as much for the chicken as usual, so I don't think I have enough money...",

"Did I hear that right just now? I told you to not let that Greenwood butcher overcharge you. Now, you have wasted the money I earned through hard work and given it to these damn lowlives. I bet Cedric would have never done that. Why can't you be more like your brother? You'll have to use your own money then. I hope that you still have some left after going drinking again last night!",

"Yes, father.",

"You both finish up your meal and you see your father climbing up the stairs, most likely to look after your mother. You turn towards the door with a sigh and get on your way again. Whatever your father said, that is what you will do. That is just how it is. Boring, but who are you to be able to change it. Some other boys were able to start an apprenticeship in another village, but you had to stay here and help with running the household since your mother was sick. So half of the time, you spend walking around the village running errands and the other half you spend dozing around with Peter, or helping out other people around the village, sometimes even for a small reward. But wait, who are you to change it? That is exactly what Thomas said. You can change it. You can decide for yourself. After opening the creaking door, you find yourself blinded by the sun, which has burned its way through the clouds and now gleams with warming light. It truly is spring. You move your tired limbs around a bit in the sun and then get on your way. The chores still have to be done, but first you want to meet with Peter."
