        "You enter the South-Eastern quarter and start walking between smaller, somewhat run down houses. There is nothing much here except for the herbalist, tailor, and the mill. Oh and of course that second rate smith Tarik that you are going to right now. Everybody knows that Oscar Greenwood is a much better craftsman, but of course he is a Greenwood. And one cannot trust a Greenwood. That is what your father and Eric have taught you from when you were a child. They cannot be trusted. You keep moving, kicking up dust from the narrow lane that you are walking on. In the background, you hear some chickens cackling, as you arrive at Tarik’s house. To your dismay you see that the fire has not been started yet and its owner seems to still be asleep. But you get lucky and right when you decide to turn around, the tall man with his gigantic beer belly walks out the door.",
        "Is that you Taurin? What do you want?",
        "Father sent me to collect an order that was supposed to be done today.",
        "Right, right that thing. Well, it’s not done yet. Come back later, there is still some stuff to do.",
        "But...",
        "No buts. I told your father it would be done today and it will be done today. But not so early in the morning.",
        "You curse at Tarik under your breath, so that you hope he doesn't hear you. At least it is starting to get a bit warmer and your hands are becoming a more acceptable color again.",
        "Acting up is way to scary, so there is nothing you can do. At least it is starting to get a bit warmer and your hands are becoming a more acceptable color again.",
        "Still squinting due to the brightness of the sun, you see him going to work and starting up the fire. A little annoyed, but powerless, you turn around and grumble something about why you have to get up so early, when other people don’t do either. What a waste of time! Well, everything else is done, so you guess you might as well go back home. But not through these shady side streets, the main roads have a lot more sun. You make your way back to the cobbled street and enjoy a quick break letting the sun shine in your face. Ahhh, that feels good."
