      "Taurin, Wake Up!",
      "I'm coming!",
      "You convince yourself to part with the comforting warmth of your bed and tear the pelt that covered you during the night from your body. Immediately, you regret your decision, but still hurry to the chair in the corner of the small room that you share with your older brother to get your clothes. Even though spring has started, the mornings are still freezing cold. You look at your bed longingly for a few seconds, but then make your way downstairs. Your stomach is yearning for something to fill it, so breakfast seems like a very reasonable option. At least that is one thing to look forward to. Otherwise it will probably be another boring day in this village in the middle of nowhere. The thought of running away to the closest city has often crossed your mind, but you were never able to work up the courage to even talk about it with your friends. That way, daily chores around the household are all that you can probably expect from today. It is not like anything exciting ever happens here in Elsberry.",
      "As you walk down the stairs to the ground floor, the wooden steps creak under your feet, which you take to be quite unpleasant. Could the few beers from last night really have given you a hangover? Ridiculous! Still, it would probably be better to be more careful when Peter offers a bet. Downstairs, the dull smell of porridge greets you along with a worried look by your little sister. She is standing next to the steaming cauldron that contains the grayish slime that will constitute your breakfast. Your father, and older brother are already sitting on the small table next to the fire, shoveling the unappetizing substance into their mouths with crooked wooden spoons. You join them and enjoy the warmth of the oven fire on your back as you fill your stomach.",
      "Taurin, were you out drinking last night again? Take yourself your brother Cedric as an example. He went to bed early and got up this morning to come and help out your sister. He works hard at the glass workshop every day. He is of real Mountainspring blood. He brings honor to the name of our clan. And I do not have to tell you how much we owe to our clan, right?",
      "Yes, Father.",
      "I am happy to hear that then. Come on boy, eat up! The day is not waiting for us to get started. I have some things for you today, so listen carefully.  I need you to pick up an order that I placed with the smith in the south-east quarter. The money has already been paid, so just get the stuff and leave. Then I need you to pick up the usual herbs for your mother. We are running out again and if we can not make her medicine, then… ",
      "Well, you know...",
      "Anyways, before I forget it, I think, the time has come that we can afford some meat for our stew tonight, so go to the butcher and get us a chicken. Do you hear me, son? But watch out, you know the butcher is a Greenwood and we can not trust anyone with Greenwood blood one bit. Not a single bit! So watch out that he does not overcharge you. You understand that, son?",
      "Yes, Father.",
      "Alright, here take a bit of money, that should be enough. And if there is any change left to it, you better bring it home. If I see you around the tavern tonight, then God save you. We need to bring honor to the Mountainspring name. Do you hear me? The reputation of our clan is the most important thing, never forget that.",
      "Yes, Father.",
      "Well, then off you go. Nobody will ever wait on you, just because you feel like sitting around. And don’t stay any second longer in the South-Western quarter than necessary. It is Greenwood territory and we do not want anything to do with them. Just get the meat and come back here. Ahh, tonight will be a feast.",
      "You slowly stand up and go outside. The door creaks as you open it, but you do not even notice that anymore. It is not like it will be fixed any time soon. You step into the small square in front of your house. The air smells great this morning. So fresh! But you are more worried about the burning sensation the cold is creating in your hands, so you quickly stuff them into your pockets. Here we go: let’s survive another day.",
      "You start moving across the small, circular square in front of your house. Your shoes get a bit dirty from the dust you kick up, but you have more important things on your mind. Like how to keep your hands from turning purple. Suddenly somebody runs into your left side. As that person seems to have been running, you almost fall over, but are just barely able to catch yourself.",
      "Sorry, Taurin. I am in a bit of a hurry. Something’s down in the South-West quarter.",
      "In front of you stands a teenage boy with blond hair, a little puny for his age, but seemingly brimming with energy. Isn’t he the guy who runs errands for Eric, our clan leader? Why would he care about what happens in the South-West, Greenwood territory? But Erin is already on his way again, so there is no time for further questions. Still, this is quite unusual. Nothing important ever happens in this village.",
      "Should you follow the boy or first do your chores?"
