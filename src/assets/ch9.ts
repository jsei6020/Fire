        "The chicken has to go home, so that Sophie can start prepping it for dinner. You start heading up the big cobbled street towards the town square. From further away you see Thomas, the hunter, coming towards you. It is not entirely legal to hunt in the forests around the village, because it all belongs to the Duke. But since none of the villagers would ever say no to some extra meat, nobody would ever betray him to the authorities. You have spent quite a bit of time with him over the past few years, so you can recognize his big brown leather jacket and gigantic dark mustache from far away. As long as you have known him, Thomas has lived alone. You tried to ask him a few times, why he does not find himself a wife to take care of the household for him, but he never gave you a satisfying answer. One time, after he had a couple of drinks he just looked at you and you could see the tears starting to fill his eyes. That is when you stopped asking him. He is a honest guy that despite not belonging to a clan is at least not hated by anybody in the village. You envy him a bit for his freedom to do whatever he likes, not having to always think about the reputation of the 'Mountainspring Blood'. Your dad goes on and on about this stuff every day, so you have gotten quite tired of hearing about it. But then again, better a Mountainspring than a Greenwood. Fucking bastards. Thomas is now quite close and gives you a small nod as a greeting.",
        "Have you heard what happened? Oscar punched Junior unconscious last night and is now being put in prison. I bet they will have a trial soon. We are going to get him back for what he did to the son of our leader and the nephew of our mayor! That will at least be some torture.",
        "Is that so? That does not really sound like Oscar. Why would he go so far as to punch somebody unconscious that is clearly weaker than him?",
        "Are you trying to insult us? Ah, no you would not. I guess, you are right, Junior is a little bit weaker. Hah, but if there would have been more of us, Oscar would not have stood a chance. But apparently, Junior just wanted to have a nice little meeting with the Smith's daughter. I have to admit, she is quite the pretty little thing. But in the end, a Greenwood girl is not worth more than a handful of dirt, no matter how pretty she is. Anyways, that is no reason to punch somebody's lights out. What do you think?",
        "I think, you are not getting the whole story here. Oscar is a calm guy, if he actually did what you said he did, something must have made him very angry. Maybe you should hear his version of the events as well, before you come to a judgment.",
        "What are you trying to say? That I should not trust the word of my own clan members and instead listen to a lowly Greenwood? No way. They can not be trusted. I have known that since I was born. And everybody says it as well.",
        "No, no, I am not saying that you should not trust your friends and elders. But that does not mean that you can take everything that they have given and told you for granted. If you just accept everything that the people around you believe, you will also accept a lot of opinions that are simply not right. Just because everybody around you says something, does not make it automatically true. You have the ability and the responsibility to think by yourself and come up with your own judgments. You have the power to decide how to interpret what you see and hear. Everybody has that power. You can decide your truths, values and principles and then act upon them. It is your responsibility to reflect on what you have learned throughout your life and check for anything that does not serve you. You have been taught from your earliest days that Mountainspring blood is pure and sacred. That Mountainsprings are something better, just as Greenwoods are lowly creatures that bring nothing but misery. But do you truly know that this is true? You are the master over your interpretations of reality. You have the power to decide. And therefore you have the power to cast away what is useless. Do you really think such a hatred of an entire group of people just because of their clan is serving you? Do you really think, believing every word of a person, just because he is part of your clan is useful? You have the power to decide. And you have the power to act on your decisions.",
        "And just like that he keeps walking towards his little hut at the end of the street and leaves you there, standing in the middle of the street. What does he mean by: I can decide? Why would I need to decide?",
	"Greenwoods are bastards. Nothing will change that! That is something that every Mountainspring knows. And you are a Mountainspring!",
	"Maybe Thomas has a point, maybe you should start deciding for myself. How many times have Greenwoods actually treated you badly? You need to think more about this."
